# Planet Simulation

A dynamic planet simulation using Pygame that visualizes the solar system, showcasing the orbits and interactions of celestial bodies. This project allows users to zoom in and out, pan the view, and interact with the planets to see their distances from the sun.

## Features

- **Realistic Gravitational Interactions**: Simulates the gravitational pull between planets and the sun.
- **Zooming and Panning**: Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out, and arrow keys to pan the view.
- **Planetary Information**: Displays the name and distance of selected planets.
- **Interactive Controls**: Allows users to pause and resume the simulation, adjust speed, and add/remove planets.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Twoos123/Python-Planetsim.git
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python planetsim.py
   ```

## Controls

- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in and out.
- **Arrow Keys**: Pan the view.
- **+ / - Keys**: Adjust zoom level.
- **P Key**: Pause and Resume the simulation.

## Future Improvements

- Implement elliptical orbits for more accuracy.
- Add collision detection between planets and the sun.
- Optimize orbit drawing for performance with more planets.
